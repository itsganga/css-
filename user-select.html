<p> In this experiment we dissolved 67.5g of zinc nitrate into 150 ml of distilled water and then stirred for 90 min. After that 30g of starch was dissolved in 450 ml of distilled water and stirred for 90 min at 75 C to achieve a starch cloudy solution. Then zinc nitrate containing solution was added to the cloudy starch solution. Stirring was continued until the mixture attained for gelatinization of starch. The solution placed in a water bath at 80Â°C temperature. The stirring process was sustained for duration of 10 hours. Then stirred solution was centrifuged at 8500rpm for 5min and collected into a petridish, and kept drying over night to formation of a yellowish powder. To obtain ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs), the final product was calcined in muffle furnace at 500C in presence of air after 8h of calcination we got a white powder.</p>
