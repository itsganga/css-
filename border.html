<p> Starch, which exists in various botanical sources such as potato, wheat, and corn, exhibits diverse structures and compositions. Regardless of the botanical origin, starch has amylose and amylopectin. These components are polymers of alpha-glucose units in the 4C1 conformation. In amylose, the glucose units arelinked (1-4), with the ring oxygen atoms positioned on the same side. In amylopectin, approximately one in every twenty glucose units is linked (1-6), forming branch-points.
Throughout the heating process, the nitrate undergoes decomposition, resulting in the release of nitrogen dioxide and oxygen. These byproducts are subsequently removed. The representation below illustrates the hydrolysis process and the interaction between zinc cations and starch.

<p>To check the antimicrobial activity of obtained powder we need fresh E coli culture. Prepare a fresh culture of E. coli by inoculating a nutrient broth with a pure culture of E. coli and incubated it at appropriate temperature (usually 37°C) for a specific period until reaching the desired cell density. Then agar plat was prepared and pour nutrient agar into sterile Petri dishes and allowed it to solidify. Using a sterilized looptransferred a standardized volume of the <i>E. coli</i> culture onto the surface of the agar plate, evenly spreading the bacteria. Created wells in the agar using a sterilized puncher and ZnO NPs was carefully added a specific volume into the wells using a micropipette. It was important to include appropriate controls, such as wells with a sterile medium or a known antimicrobial agent, to ensure accuracy.
Plate was placed in an incubator at the appropriate temperature (37°C) and incubated for a specific duration of 24 hours, to allow bacterial growth.After the incubation period, observed the agar plates for the presence of inhibition zones around the wells containing ZnO-NPs. The inhibition zones indicate the antimicrobial activity of ZnO-NPs in <i>E. coli</i>.
