			  <p>Starch, which exists in various botanical sources such as potato, wheat, and corn, exhibits diverse structures and compositions. Regardless of the botanical origin, starch has amylose and amylopectin. These components are polymers of alpha-glucose units in the 4C1 conformation. In amylose, the glucose units arelinked (1-4), with the ring oxygen atoms positioned on the same side. In amylopectin, approximately one in every twenty glucose units is linked (1-6), forming branch-points.
                 Throughout the heating process, the nitrate undergoes decomposition, resulting in the release of nitrogen dioxide and oxygen. These byproducts are subsequently removed. The representation below illustrates the hydrolysis process and the interaction between zinc cations and starch.</p>
