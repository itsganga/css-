<p> ZnO nanoparticles were obtained using the sol-gel method. Analysis of XRD and FTIR data revealed that XRD exhibited the characteristic spherical shape structure. The results from SEM and XRD indicated that the peaks are obtained as standard peaks and the size range lies between 100-150nm. Based on the reaction and the obtained results, it was observed that starch plays role of a stabilizer and polymerizing agent for the large-scale preparation of ZnO-NPs using the sol-gel method. Overall, this study demonstrates the viability of the sol-gel method with starch as a promising approach for the synthesis of ZnO-NPs with desired characteristics. Further research can explore the applications of these synthesized ZnO-NPs in various such as optoelectronics, catalysis, and biomedical applications, considering their well-defined structure and controlled properties.</p>

 <p> The response of ZnO NPs on plants was observed. Further investigations should be conducted to analysis of different doses of ZnO-NPs under laboratory and field conditions, as well as in the presence of various stress factors, to determine the optimal doses for normal and stressed environments. The appropriate utilization of ZnO NPs could also contribute to enhancing crop quality and nutritional value, benefiting human nutrition.</p>

Preparation of Hoagland solution: All the macro and micronutrients were taken and macronutrients weighted and for micronutrients 1M stoke solution were prepared. All the nutrients added into a flask and volumemaintained 500mL adding distilled water.
Then 9 (20ml) test tubes and hoagland media were autoclaved for 15 min at 120â„ƒ. 
The hoagland poured in each test tube (25ml) each and different seeds were put in pair of 3 test tubes and kept for growth in dark room in presence of light.
