Energy is the basic requirement for a nation's development and improvement of people's lifestyles. But in the current global scenario, the use of fossil fuels as a primary source of energy will drastically deplete fossil energy resources in the upcoming years. The current consumption of fossil fuels by people is around 80%. Fossil fuel consumption creates greenhouse gases (e.g., CO2 and CH4), particulate matter and toxic gases all of which contribute to the pollution, acid rain, and global warming.
